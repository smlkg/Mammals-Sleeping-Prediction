# Predicting Sleeping Variables in Mammals

This project aims to develop predictive models for estimating sleeping variables in mammals. The dataset comprises various features related to mammalian behavior and physiology, with the target variable being sleeping patterns. Three different modeling approaches are explored: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, Random Forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains observations of sleeping variables in mammals, along with features such as physiological measurements, environmental factors, and behavioral indicators. Each observation represents a mammalian species, and the target variable is the sleeping pattern, categorized into different classes based on duration, quality, and other characteristics.
